## üìã Overview

This script provides a **real-time snapshot** of:

- The last 10 inbound messages received
- The last 10 outbound messages sent
- Current queue status (active, retrying, etc.)
- Messages currently waiting in queues

It refreshes the output every few seconds (default: 10), giving system administrators a live dashboard for troubleshooting and visibility into message flow.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Exchange Server 2016** (may also work on 2013/2019 with minor adjustments)
- **PowerShell with appropriate permissions**
- Must be run from a machine with the **Exchange Management Tools** installed (or directly on the Exchange server)

---

## üßæ Script Configuration

You can configure the following parameters at the top of the script:

```powershell
$server = "EXCHANGE01"         # Your Exchange server name
$refreshInterval = 10          # Seconds between refreshes
$lookBackMinutes = 5           # How far back to look in logs (minutes)
```

---

1. Open PowerShell **as Administrator**.
2. Run the script:
    ```powershell
    .\ExchangeMailFlowMonitor.ps1

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Considerations

- The script uses `Get-MessageTrackingLog`, `Get-Queue`, and `Get-Message` ‚Äî make sure your user account has the necessary **Exchange permissions**.
- Output may vary based on your organization's message tracking and retention settings.
- If you're running this in a multi-server environment, consider adapting the script to iterate over multiple servers.
